### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome :)
Here, you will find most of my open-source projects. Although I also have an account on GitLab as well.
Working in these fields are exciting for me:
- GPGPU 
- FPGA-based acceleration
- Deep learning
- Computer Architecture
- Dynamic Precision Scaling

Currenty, I am actively looking for new opportunities to persue a doctrate in computer science / computer engineering.
