Welcome! Here you will find most of my open-source projects. Although, I also have an account on GitLab.  
Working in these fields are exciting to me:
- FPGA-based Acceleration 
- Energy-efficient Algorithms And Circuits
- GPGPU 
- Deep learning
- Computer Architecture

Currenty, I am actively looking for new opportunities to persue a doctrate in computer science / computer engineering.
